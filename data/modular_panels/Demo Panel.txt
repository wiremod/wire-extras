#	This file demonstates the use of all the widgets that will work with wire.
#	warning: make sure everything is tab deliminated, NO SPACES (will fuck thinks up at the moment) 
#	only use optional parameters when you really need to as they will use up the user massage quickly (they are strings),
#	all widgets have default parameters anyway.
#
#	If your panel doesn't build right, it's probably because you've used up the usermessage
#
#	textbox		: is very bulky. use labels unless you really need the features of textbox.
#	rect		: setting colours will use a lot of the usermessage, try to use colour schemes first.
