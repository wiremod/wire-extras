# Wiremod Extras

This is the Unofficial Wire Extras addon.

These are very experimental extras, have no guarantee whatsoever that they work without flaws or security holes, and may even be flat out broken and interfere with other modifications.

While the wiremod project itself is more strict on what addons will be added to the project (with the main concern focused around long term maintainability), wire extras allows more user contributed entities and stools, with the warning that everything is much more experimental.
